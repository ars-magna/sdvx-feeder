# sdvx-feeder

Tray app to feed keyboard inputs to analog inputs for SDVX.. eventually...

I've got the debug binary in here or whatever so feel free to grab it in its current state here: https://github.com/ars-magna/sdvx-feeder/raw/master/sdvx-feeder/bin/Debug/sdvx-feeder.exe

Check back for updates because right now it does nothihng haha lole

To do (In order of priority):

1. Integrate python script to run with the tray app
2. Make configurable via configuration file
3. Make configurable via GUI that also saves to the configuration file (That's what that will eventually do!)
4. Make icons instead of using a booth icon!!
5. Add a MIDI mode toggle (For myself but maybe someone will want it one day)
6. ???
