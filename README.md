# sdvx-feeder

Tray app to feed keyboard inputs to analog inputs for SDVX.. eventually...

I've got the debug binary in here or whatever so feel free to grab it in its current state here: https://github.com/ars-magna/sdvx-feeder/raw/master/sdvx-feeder/bin/Debug/sdvx-feeder.exe

Check back for updates because right now it does nothihng haha lole

UPDATE: 
While maybe I will finish this when I feel like it (so I probably won't mess with it again idk) SpiceTools has all of this built in so use that instead probably hehe

To do (In order of priority):

1. Create integrated vJoy Feeder in C# (Including rewriting original python script in C#)
2. Make configurable via configuration file
3. Make configurable via GUI that also saves to the configuration file (That's what that will eventually do!)
4. Make icons instead of using a booth icon!! (That's a filler icon!!)
5. Add a MIDI mode toggle (For myself but maybe someone will want it one day??)
6. ???

Project dead due to other tools maturing to this point at about the same time as I started working on it
